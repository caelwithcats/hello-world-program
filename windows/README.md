# Windows
Unless you have MinGW installed, the x64 based executable will not work. Try the x32-bit one.

There is also 16-bit binaries. Yes 16-bit. It is a GUI application. The source code is in `win3.1-16-bit-gui.CPP`. You will need Windows 3.1 to run it. You may be able to compile this code for Windows 10. The win32 API isn't very different from back then.

There is 16-bit executables and source code. I used the boreland C++ compiler on windows 3.1 to compile the 16-bit application.
