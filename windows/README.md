# Windows
Unless you have MinGW installed, the x64 based executable will not work. Try the x32-bit one.

There is also 16-bit binaries. Yes 16-bit. It is a GUI application. The source code is in `win3.1-16-bit-gui.CPP`. You will need Windows 3.1 to run it. You may be able to compile this code for Windows 10. The win32 API isn't very different from back then.
